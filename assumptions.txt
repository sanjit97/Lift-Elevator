Assumptions
 There are total 10 floors and maximum number of people that can enter in the lift is 8.
 0 stands for ground floor and 10 stands for 10th floor.
 Every time there is a prompt asking user to call the lift or not. If he/she types yes, the lift would be called and if he/she types no, the lift won't be called(the program will stop there)
 Once the user types yes, the current position,direction and status will be shown to the user
 The floor number of the user will be taken as input and based on that the lift will be processed to that floor.
 The program assumes that the persons entering from a floor are travelling to the same destination via the lift.
 There will be a time delay of 60s when the lift is in the same floor as the user and a time delay of 10s while travelling from source floor to destination floor.
 The program will run as long as the user types no as the choice to call lift.
